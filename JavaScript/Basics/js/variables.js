//JavaScript Lesson - 01 VARIABLES (LearnToCode by Dilum De Silva)

//here i'm assinging some string values in to variables
//we use 'var' keyword to declare a vairble in JavaScript
var firstName = "Dilum";
var middleName = "De";
var lastName = "Silva";

//var has the abbbility to identify the type of the varible when assigned values to a variable
//so no need to declare the data type of the varible as is in other programming languages

//you can check what i have mentioned above using those two varibles when you print the value of it in line 31
var age = 22
var age1 = 22.3;

var sentencePart1 = "I am";
var sentencePart2 = "years' old";

//if you want you can concatinate any of those varible using '+' sign as you do in other languages.
var sentence = sentencePart1 + sentencePart2;

//How to declare a boolean varible
var genderCheck = true;

var gender = "Male";

alert("Hello " +firstName);

document.write("My name is "+ firstName+" "+middleName+" "+lastName);

document.write(" and "+sentencePart1+" "+age+" "+sentencePart2);
